* Ideas
 - function to find array in array? cant deal with stuff between legs i think
 - regex? hard to generate? could it even match?
* Extra features / Things to consider
 - Rotation
 - different look(s): what if a friendly bug looks like a regular + some extras
 - partially covered bugs / broken input
 - bugs next to each other
 - memory usage: whole landscape in-memory?
 - colorized output for detected bugs
 - padding unfinished lines
* TODOs [4/7]
  - [X] input sanity checks
    (e.g. only lines of equal length - or fill with blanks?)
  - [-] edge case tests
    - [X] landscape smaller than
    - [ ] empty bug
  - [X] inheriting from 'object' yes/no?
  - [ ] closing file streams
  - [ ] prepared test files vs file generation?
  - [X] unify assertions
  - [X] variable naming style
