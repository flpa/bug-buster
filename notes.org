* Ideas
 - function to find array in array? cant deal with stuff between legs i think
 - regex? hard to generate? could it even match?
* Added Complexity
 - rotation
 - different look(s): what if a friendly bug looks like a regular + some extras
 - partially covered bugs / broken input
 - bugs next to each other
 - memory usage: whole landscape in-memory?
