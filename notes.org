* Ideas
 - function to find array in array? cant deal with stuff between legs i think
 - regex? hard to generate? could it even match?
* Extra features / Things to consider
 - Rotation
 - different look(s): what if a friendly bug looks like a regular + some extras
 - partially covered bugs / broken input
 - bugs next to each other
 - memory usage: whole landscape in-memory?
 - colorized output for detected bugs
* TODOs [0/5]
  - [ ] input sanity checks
    (e.g. only lines of equal length - or fill with blanks?)
  - [ ] edge case tests
    - landscape smaller than bug
    - ...
  - [ ] inheriting from 'object' yes/no?
  - [ ] closing file streams
  - [ ] prepared test files vs file generation?
